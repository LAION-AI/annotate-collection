        "Interest": {
          "rating": 0,

        "Disappointment": {
          "rating": 0,
          "reasoning": "While there's tension, the presence of a smile makes simple disappointment less likely; features are not downturned in sadness."
        },
        "Sadness": {

        "Anger": {
          "rating": 0,

        "Pain": {
          "rating": 0,
          "reasoning": "While AU6 (cheek raiser/eye crinkle) can indicate pain, the clear smile suggests this is not the primary driver of the expression."
